# Gomoku

## Overview

Welcome to the Gomoku project! This application is a fresh take on the classic board game Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, implemented in Haskell. Our goal is to create a highly interactive, user-friendly, and intelligent Gomoku game that leverages the unique features of Haskell, such as strong static typing, purity, and conciseness, to ensure a robust and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Goals

1. **Implement Gomoku Logic in Haskell**: At the core of this project is the implementation of the traditional Gomoku game rules and logic using Haskell. This includes board representation, game state management, and win condition checks.

2. **User Interface**: Develop a simple yet intuitive user interface (UI) that allows players to interact with the game easily. This might be a text-based UI in the initial phases, with plans to evolve into a graphical user interface (GUI).

3. **Network Play**: Implement network capabilities to allow two players to play against each other over the internet.

4. **Open Source Contribution**: Develop this application as an open-source project, encouraging contributions and collaborations from the Haskell and game development communities.
